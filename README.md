# ProtectThePenguins
My first game jam submission on GodotWilJam #53 ! 

## GamePlay ##
Basically the penguins assemble their prayers ( tap on ppenguins ) so the clouds have rain, the rain is used as fire extinguisher therefore protecting the penguins cult from fire !
If a cloud is taken by fire, you can reconstruct it with more prayers !

## Controls ##
Tap on penguins to pray and have more rain
There is one cloud controlled by mouse left click to shoot and the others shoot automatically based on range.

### UPDATE ###
Added one new enemy ( blue flame )
adjusted the fonts and performance
